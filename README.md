Basis is a linear algebra library written in C as an exercise to revise linear algebra and low-level programming concepts.

Here are the operations that this library hopes to accomplish:
- [x] Matrix File IO
- [x] Basic Vector Operations
- Basic Matrix Operations
    - [x] Generate Identity Matrices
    - [x] Trace
    - [x] Transpose
    - [x] Mean (returns the average of each column in a matrix)
    - [x] Matrix Multiplication
    - [x] Scaling
    - [ ] Solve Equations of the form `Ax = b`
- Advanced Matrix Operations
    - [ ] Gram-Schmidt (For orthonormalising a set of vectors)
    - [ ] Determining Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
    - [ ] Determinants
    - [ ] Matrix Inverse
    - [ ] LU (with Partial Pivoting), QR, SVD Decomposition
    - [ ] Least Squares Solution to `Ax = b`
    - [ ] Polynomial and Cubic Spline interpolation
-  Linear Programming
    - [ ] Simplex Method
    - [ ] Minimax based AI player for simple games
    - [ ] Optimal Transport
